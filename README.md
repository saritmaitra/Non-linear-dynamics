## Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Nonlinear Dynamics
This foundational chapter introduces the core principles of nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory, concepts essential for understanding complex economic systems. You'll explore how small changes in initial conditions can produce dramatically different outcomes, a phenomenon critical to financial markets, business cycles, and policy interventions. Key topics include bifurcations, strange attractors, Lyapunov exponents, and sensitivity analysis. Through stochastic differential equations and numerical methods (Euler and Runge-Kutta), you will learn to simulate and analyze nonlinear systems, establishing the mathematical toolkit used throughout the book.
## Chapter 2: Endogeneity in Econometric Models
Endogeneity poses one of the most significant challenges in empirical economics, when explanatory variables correlate with the error term, standard regression produces biased, unreliable estimates. This chapter examines common sources: omitted variables, measurement error, and simultaneity. You will master diagnostic tests (Wu-Hausman, Sargan) and solution methods including Instrumental Variables (IV), Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS), and Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). Practical implementations demonstrate how to identify valid instruments and restore causal inference in economic models.
## Chapter 3: Asymmetric Price Transmission
Markets often exhibit asymmetric responses: prices rise quickly when costs increase but fall slowly when costs decrease, a nonlinear behavior with significant implications for consumers, producers, and policymakers. This chapter investigates Asymmetric Price Transmission (APT) in energy and commodity markets using advanced time series techniques. You will implement Vector Autoregression (VAR), Threshold VAR (TVAR), and Markov Regime Switching models to detect, quantify, and forecast regime-dependent pricing dynamics. Practical applications include scenario simulations for policy evaluation.
## Chapter 4: Physics-Inspired Gravity Model in Economics
Borrowing from Newton's law of gravitation, the Gravity Model has become a cornerstone of international trade analysis, explaining bilateral trade flows based on economic size and geographic distance. This chapter extends the basic framework to incorporate policy variables (tariffs, trade agreements), cultural factors (common language, colonial ties), and structural features (multilateral resistance). You'll work with panel data methods and Poisson Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood (PPML) estimation to handle zero trade flows and heteroskedasticity. Counterfactual simulations demonstrate how to quantify trade policy impacts and forecast macroeconomic outcomes.
## Chapter 5: Machine Learning for Economic Anomaly Detection
Economic and financial systems generate complex, high-dimensional data where traditional statistical methods struggle to identify irregular patterns. This chapter applies AI and machine learning techniques to detect anomalies from fraudulent transactions to structural breaks in economic relationships. You will implement Isolation Forests, Autoencoders, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, One-Class Support Vector Machines, and Local Outlier Factor algorithms. Beyond fraud detection, these techniques offer powerful tools for identifying regime changes, outlier events, and nonlinear patterns in economic data, bridging traditional econometrics with modern machine learning.
