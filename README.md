# Non-linear-dynamics
Historically, economic analysis predominantly relied on linear models, particularly in the nascent stages of econometrics and microeconomic theory. However, the limitations of this approach became increasingly apparent when confronted with real-world economic phenomena. Traditional linear models proved insufficient in explaining occurrences such as market instability and unpredictable fluctuations. Furthermore, economic policies formulated solely on the basis of linear assumptions frequently resulted in unintended consequences. Consequently, modern economic theories have evolved to incorporate these nonlinear aspects, thereby enhancing our understanding of complex economic dynamics.
